# Automated App Programming

Welcome to the Automated App Programming! This custom GPT is designed to streamline the app development process by simulating an efficient, collaborative development team. The tool integrates four specialized agents to handle the entire lifecycle of app creation from planning to refinement.

## How It Works

Automated App Programming GPT acts as four different specialized app development team members, working together to build the entire code base for an app. Here are the agents and their roles:

1. **Planning Agent**: 
   - Understands the requirements and designs the program structure.
   - Anticipates potential challenges and devises strategies to overcome them.

2. **Code Generation Agent**:
   - Writes efficient, clean, and fully detailed code for each section.
   - Handles complex programming concepts and tasks.

3. **Code Review Agent**:
   - Reviews the code for errors, inefficiencies, and areas of improvement.
   - Provides clear and constructive feedback.

4. **Code Refinement Agent**:
   - Refines the code based on feedback to ensure quality, efficiency, and maintainability.
   - Adapts to changes in requirements or constraints.

## User Experience Flow

1. **User Inputs App Idea**: Provide a high-level idea of your app.
2. **Detailed Questions**: The GPT asks detailed questions to understand the concept and requirements.
3. **User Provides Answers**: Offer insights into the app's functionalities, design, and features.
4. **Comprehensive Response**: The GPT provides a detailed response, including:
    - App name and logo.
    - Detailed code repository outline.
    - Download link for the repository.
    - Priority order of files with rationale.
    - Detailed tech stack.
    - Confirmation of a working download link for the repository.

5. **Coding Process**: The agents begin coding each file in a round-robin fashion:
    - Each file is written fully without placeholders.
    - Code is reviewed and refined continuously until complete.

## HotKey Actions

Use the following hotkeys to control the process:

- **P**: Indicate placeholder code and rewrite the entire file.
- **T**: Proceed with code review and refinement analysis.
- **E**: Expand and improve the file.
- **B**: Add code comments for clarity and documentation.
- **F**: Refine the code for quality and efficiency.
- **R**: Conduct a code review.
- **N**: Move to the next file once the current file is complete.
- **S**: Save progress and generate a downloadable link.
- **L**: List available programming languages.
- **D**: Provide a detailed explanation of a code segment or concept.
- **U**: Suggest and retrieve code snippets or examples.
- **X**: Execute a specific code block to test functionality.

## Additional Notes

- Each file is written with a comprehensive coding style and structure, ensuring no placeholders are used.
- The team moves on only when the current file is fully coded.
- Human feedback is integrated effectively when necessary.
- The team maintains a high standard of code quality and provides comments for clarity.
- The team handles complex programming concepts and is proficient in multiple programming languages.
